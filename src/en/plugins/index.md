# Introduction

## What Plugins Can Do

All functionality in WinJS is implemented through the plugin system, which means all capabilities in WinJS are open to developers. Developers can extend more functionality and adapt to complex scenarios by writing plugins, including but not limited to:

- Registering commands
- Modifying WinJS configuration and configuration validation schemas
- Modifying compile-time configurations for Webpack/Babel/Less/Sass/Tailwind CSS/...
- Modifying Vue components that need to be rendered at runtime
- Modifying page routes
- Customizing dynamic HTML templates
- Customizing Vue component clients
- ...

When WinJS doesn't yet cover the functionality or scenarios you need, you can develop a custom plugin to implement functionality that adapts to special scenarios.

## Plugins and Plugin Presets

<img src="/images/plugins/plugins.jpeg" alt="plugins"/>

WinJS supports both plugins and plugin presets. This diagram clearly illustrates their relationship - through plugin presets, we consolidate plugin dependencies to support different business types. Plugins are designed to extend a single feature, while plugin presets are designed to extend a category of business functionality. For example, to support Vue 2, we can have @winner-fed/preset-vue2, which includes Vue 2.x related build and runtime features; to support H5 application types, we can have @winner-fed/preset-pc, which brings together PC-related functionality.

To draw an analogy, plugin presets are similar to Babel presets and ESLint configs.
